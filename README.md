# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
The aim of the project was to create learning algorithms<br>
machine on three data sets from the field of medicine and creation<br>
the "iProtect" system enabling the testing of trained algorithms<br>
by providing a simple and intuitive user interface for you to be<br>
the possibility of entering specific data and making predictions<br>
threats from a given data set on which the algorithms were trained, as well<br>
monitoring the performance of algorithms in this system.<br>
